I am a historian of Russia and the Soviet Union, and write about the environment, science and technology. My academic interest focuses on how the everyday use of technology and science affect politics and the natural world. My dissertation project focuses on the Soviet synthetic rubber industry, a subject that delves into a wide variety of topics ranging from chemistry, industry, socialism, agriculture, world trade, war, and imperialism all into one story that focuses on the desire of societies to consume and use specific products and commodities in their daily lives.

I am currently a PhD Student in History at Northern Illinois University, with an M.A. (2017) in Russian, East European, and Eurasian Studies from the University of Michigan, and a B.A. (2014) in History from the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
